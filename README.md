# jupyter-zfssa-analysis
Jupyter Notebook to analyse my zfssa **Work in progress**

This notebooks needs the output from my zfs script explorer <https://github.com/aldenso/zfssa-scripts/tree/master/explorer>

After generating the explorer you can adjust the csv path in the notebooks to your unzipped explorer.
